# Your Mother -- a chores-charging agent, built FROM the plow-hermes-agent base.
#
# No boot, no gateway config, no model wiring here: those are the base's, and
# arrive as a digest bump, and so does the Agent Index reporter. This repo adds
# one thing -- the persona and skills of one assistant -- plus the process
# timezone.
#
# The tag is an immutable base-<sha> naming one commit of
# plow-pbc/plow-hermes-agent, resolved to a digest, so a moving tag can never
# substitute different bytes under a running agent.

# Which agent this is on the Agent Index. Compose sets this too, and a Plow
# cloud deploy does not: the provisioner only knows AGENT_ID for the variants
# it lists, and a self-published image is not one of them. Without it the
# base's reporter (s6 service agent-index) refuses to guess and this agent
# silently stops reporting usage. It is a fact of this variant, not a secret,
# so it belongs in the image; a host that sets its own still wins, because the container environment outranks image ENV.
ENV AGENT_ID=your-mother

# Where this image comes from, who may use it, and what it is. GHCR reads the
# source label and links the package to the repository, so the Index entry,
# the code and the pinned image are one chain a stranger can walk; MIT is a
# condition of ranking on the leaderboard, and the digest is what Plow pins.
